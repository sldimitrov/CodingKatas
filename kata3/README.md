How Big?
roughly how many binary digits (bit) are required for the unsigned representation of:

1,000
1,000,000
1,000,000,000
1,000,000,000,000
8,000,000,000,000
My town has approximately 20,000 residences. How much space is required to store the names, addresses, and a phone number for all of these (if we store them as characters)?

I’m storing 1,000,000 integers in a binary tree. Roughly how many nodes and levels can I expect the tree to have? Roughly how much space will it occupy on a 32-bit architecture?

ANSWER:

- Number log₂(n) Bits Required

1,000 ~9.97 10 bits
1,000,000 ~19.93 20 bits
1,000,000,000 ~29.90 30 bits
1,000,000,000,000 ~39.86 40 bits
8,000,000,000,000 ~42.90 43 bits
